# This File contain all the Global Variables required to do the SIHA Upgrade.
# Please update the variables by reading the comments provided at the 
# beginning of each section.
# This variables file contain 4 sections:
#      A - Common Variables.
#      B - Single Instance HAS Upgrade.
#      C - Oracle 19c RDBMS installation.
#      D - Oracle Database Upgrade.
# Note: While doing the Single Instance Grid Upgrade, provide the DB names
# in the "source_db_name" list under Section - D.

## Section A - Common Variables

# ora_binary_location: Oracle binaries staging option, either local|nfs|remote.
# ora_nfs_host: If ora_binary_location: nfs, provide the resolvable hostname of the NFS server.
# ora_nfs_device: NFS mount path.
# ora_nfs_filesystem: Target NFS mount path.

# db_oracle_sw: Provide the 19c RDBMS s/w zipfile name along with the path on Remote or Local or NFS.
# grid_sw: Provide the 19c Grid s/w zipfile name along with the path on Remote or Local or NFS.
# apply_ru: Provide True or False. True - will apply RU patch as part of the installation. False - will install 19.3 base version.

## Section B - Single Instance Grid Variables

# grid_home_prev: Provide the 12c Grid Home Path.

# grid_user: Provide the Grid software owner.
# grid_group: Provide the Grid software owner's primary group.
# gi_osdba_group: Provide the Grid software owner's secondary group.
# gi_osasm_group: Provide asm group (osasm group name).
# gi_osoper_group: Provide osoper group name, leave it blank if not being used.
# gi_cluster_name: Leave it blank if it's unavailable.

## Section - C - Oracle 19c RDBMS installation Variables

# db_oracle_base: Provide Base path for the new 19c RDBMS Home.
# db_oracle_user: Provide the RDBMS software owner, ex: oracle.
# db_oinstall_group: Provide the RDBMS software owner's primary group, ex: oinstall.
# db_osdba_group: The OSDBA_GROUP is the OS group which is to be granted SYSDBA privileges.
# db_osoper_dba: The OSOPER_GROUP is the OS group which is to be granted SYSOPER privileges (optional).
# db_osbkup_dba: The OSBACKUPDBA_GROUP is the OS group which is to be granted SYSBACKUP privileges.
# db_osdg_dba: The OSDGDBA_GROUP is the OS group which is to be granted SYSDG privileges.
# db_oskm_dba: The OSKMDBA_GROUP is the OS group which is to be granted SYSKM privileges.
# db_osrac_dba: The OSRACDBA_GROUP is the OS group which is to be granted SYSRAC privileges.

## Section D - Database upgrade Variables
#
# autoupgrade_stage: Provide the path to the latest autoupgrade.jar utility on the target lpar.
# global_log_dir: Autoupgrade Global Directory. Provide an empty path on the AIX lpar.
# Make sure to follow the given dictionary pattern along with indentation. 
# databases:  # Based on the requirement, more number of databases can be added as a list with the following set of variables.
#     - source_db_name: Provide 12c Database Name, which needs to be upgraded.
#       source_db_home - Provide 12c Oracle Home.
#       target_db_home - Provide 19c Oracle Home, Provide a Non existent path if 19c RDBMS is not already installed.
#       log_dir - Provide a Non existent path on AIX lpar for Autoupgrade logs files.
#       start_time: NOW
#       restoration -  If yes, creates a restore point before upgrade, Flashback must be ON for this option. Set to 'no', if you don't want a restore point to be created.
# upgrade_node: localhost
#       run_utlrp: 'yes'
#       timezone_upg: 'yes'
#       target_cdb_name - This is only required when upgrading 12c Non CDB into a 19c CDB.
#       target_pdb_name - This is an optional parameter which will rename the 12c Non-CDB and plugin into 19c CDB. To be used when "target_cdb_name" is set.
